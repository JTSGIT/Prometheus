## Prometheus Analytics 🔥

## 🚀 What It Is
Prometheus is a real-time, AI-powered claim sniper. It watches BC’s expired mineral claims like a hawk, cross-references them against TSX listings, and auto-bids on the ones with merit—before the human scouts even log in.
Think of it as a trading bot, but for rocks. Except the rocks can flip for 100x your stake cost.

# 💎 Why It’s Lucrative
•  Stake cost: $1.75/ha in BC.
•  Flip price: $10k–$100k/ha during booms.
•  Your edge: You’re 30 seconds faster than the guy earning $100/hr to babysit a browser.
•  One flip pays for 6 months of coffee.

🤖 What’s Cutting Edge (And Never Been Done)
•  Live JSON sniffing: We don’t scrape HTML. We hijack the site’s own API calls mid-flight. No one’s done this on MTO before.
•  TSX merit filter: Claims only get listed if they’ve got real value. We use that as a cheat code—no geology degree needed.
•  Headless Chrome autopilot: It acts human, sleeps random, and never gets banned. Most scrapers die in 24 hours. Prometheus runs forever.

🛠️ How It Works
1.  Poll MTO every 30s via headless Chrome.
2.  Sniff the JSON for expired claims.
3.  Check merit against pre-loaded TSX listings.
4.  Stake instantly if it’s hot.
5.  Profit.

📄 Requirements
•  tsx_listings.csv: Dump of TSX/TSXV mining issuers (claim IDs in column 0).
•  Chrome + matching chromedriver.

⚠️ Legal Note
This is for educational use. Don’t blame me if you become a millionaire.

🐉 Future
•  Add ML merit scoring (proximity to Golden Triangle, soil assays).
•  Auto-sell via MTO API.
•  Go full daemon: run on a $5 VPS, wake up to cash.
You’re not mining. You’re mining miners.
Let’s steal fire. Again. 🖤
